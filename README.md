# Maze Generation Algorithm Documentation 

This repository holds the code used to generate randomized mazes based off two parameters: number of turns and path length. The code has been provided in both MATLAB and Python. 

In general, the maze algorithm is as follows: 

__Inputs__: 

__Outputs__: 

> Initialize
>> For 
>>> code
